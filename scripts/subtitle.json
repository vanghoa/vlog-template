        "This week I gotta work on designing key visuals for the art event brief based on the concepts from the research phase. Because last week, I had to leave for the career fair event so I have to make up for it. I proposed a few KVs and prepare the materials for Randy to present to the clients"
        ,
        "Through designing these KVs, I learned a lot on how the designs get to be presented to the clients. And how they get to be selected by my director. I got to learn some fun strategies to generate ideas like recycling some old tropes in Singapore or another more textual approach, using anagrams, wordplay to create some odd, quirky, funny interactions for viewers."

        "I have to work along with 2 other designers. There are a few key takeaways I get out of this teamwork. I realise that communication design in Singapore is obsessed and centered around typefaces. Designers take typography as the main source of power, which is certainly not the area that I excel at. My strength lies much more in the visualization side than making text and paragraphs legible and functional. Therefore, I got much more to learn and practice esp typography."

        "This week, nothing much happened around except for the fact that all the interns (including me) formed a gang to eat lunch in the pantry room everyday, since everyone else ate out."
